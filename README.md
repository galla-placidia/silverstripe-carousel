This module requires
[SortableGridField](http://github.com/UndefinedOffset/SortableGridField).

It implements the new **CarouselPage** type that adds a new tab in the
CMS for handling carousel _seats_ and images. The default implementation
renders the HTML in a [Bootstrap
compatible](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/javascript.html#carousel)
way, so this module is well suited to be used out of the box with
Bootstrap based themes such as
[silverstrap](http://dev.entidi.com/p/silverstrap/).

The images can be easily reordered with drag and drop and there is no
limit to the seats number.
